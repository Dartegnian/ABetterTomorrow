    "Now, hear me out.",
    "I'm NOT there to find someone to have casual sex with.",
    "NOR a fubu.",
    "I'm desperate, but not THAT desperate.",
    "The reason I made a Tinder profile was to meet new people.",
    "And, maybe, find \"the one\"",
    "or something like that.",
    "Truth be told, it's really hard for an ugly person like me to meet someone new",
    "much less actually find a girl I like and talk to them.",
    "High school is over :/",
    "Plus my current set of friends don't seem to be open to hearing my faults and problems",
    "...no one does.",
    "...",

    "Someone who can watch movies,",

    "Is it that much of a sin to ask for someone like that?",
    "So, yeah, now you know I'm on Tinder.",
    "Just getting that out.",
    "Anyway... I like the new song from SNSD.",
    "ESPECIALLY the music video.",
    "I love the very concept of it.",
    "The way that the bottle moves through different backgrounds,",
    "passing through SNSD's previous concepts.",
    "Argh, I love it so much.",

    "Props to Sooyoung, Taeyeon, Jessica, Sunny, and Seobby.",

    "But, damn, you really know how to cheer me up, haha.",
    "Ate Betina, the girl who's helped me when I was feeling down at the library.",
    "You were the one who taught me how to not get pushed around and get used by others.",
    "I appreciate you SO MUCH for telling me that.",
    "Thank you so much, Ate Betina.",
    "Oh, and Mae as well.",
