	"Sooo...",
	"SNSD's 10th anniversary is just around the corner.",
	"You know what that means :^)",
	"Oh yeah, I'm going to attend a SOSHI GATHERING SOON!",
	"Holy shit, I'm psyched.",
	"I already bought the shirt,",
	"can't wait to get it delivered and wear it.",
	"It's pink, though; I hate pink.",
	"If it came in black or white, it'd be my usual casual wear.",
	"Eh, oh well, now that I think about it, I shouldn't really care.",
	"I'm a Sone and I'm proud of my fandom, and my idols.",
	"I can't tell you how much Girls' Generation has shaped my life.",
	"Seriously, if they didn't exist, it would trigger a huge butterfly effect within my life.",
	"I wouldn't meet so much awesome people in this world,",
	"I wouldn't have conversations with some people,",
	"and, I myself as a person would be fundamentally different.",
	"Ah, I miss those \"Golden Sone Years\" of mine.",
	"There was a new meme every week,",
	"we would ramble on about how the MV for Beep Beep is still not released",
	"or ByunTaeng",
	"or TaeNy",
	"and there was always something fresh from the girls to talk about.",
	"Rumors about an upcoming Japanese album, dating rumors, stuff of the sort.",
	"I'd SPAZZ with Elaine about those all day.",
	"...Elaine",
	"...",
	"I miss Elaine",
	":(",
	"She was the best friend I could ever ask for.",
	"In the year 2013, that's when I really felt Elaine's presence in my life.",
	"I had extreme problems on that year.",
	"I was depressed, I was angry, I felt unloved",
	"I-I felt lonely.",
	"Like no one was there. No one gave two shits about me.",
	"I wanted to commit suicide that year because the pain was too unbearable for me",
	"and no one gave a shit about my mental health.",
	"Everyone who knew about my situation just thought I was crazy",
	"And they were quick to judge, no one cared about why I was acting like that",
	"And no one wanted to help.",
	"Well, except for one person",
	"Elaine.",
	"What she did helped me so much.",
	"At a time when no one else cared,",
	"she was the only one who did.",
	"She made me laugh at a time when I was depressed.",
	"She made me smile just by spazzing to me about news from SNSD.",
	"But, most of all,",
	"She made me feel loved.",
	"The world wasn't as cold as it seemed anymore",
	"and, well, through her, I slowly recovered.",
	"I mean, sure, there were times when I relapsed back into depression",
	"but she was always there to bring me back.",
	"I would tell her about my accomplishments and stuff I did",
	"in return, I'd listen to her and hear more about her life.",
	"The things she did will always stay in my heart.",
	"Most people in the world can be cruel, and some just.. indifferent.",
	"\"Oh? You're depressed? Okay, whatever, I don't fucking care.\"",
	"But, Elaine is different.",
	"I personally don't know why she did the things she did for me.",
	"I don't know why she decided to cheer me up, help me, make me laugh,",
	"sometimes she slapped some sense into me",
	"I know she's talked to my mom and she talked to me about my family problems at one point.",
	"I'm sure it was stressful on her part because I was so stubborn",
	"but we eventually came over that",
	"and we slowly became the best of friends.",
	"Even so far as to thinking that the other is a long-lost sibling.",
	"But then, late 2014 happened.",
	"With Jessica leaving the group, and with SNSD winding down their activities,",
	"Elaine and I didn't have much to talk about anymore.",
	"We just.. grew apart.",
	"I explained my feelings of missing her in my \"Missing Things\" post.",
	"I really do miss her.",
	"I miss having that someone to talk to, someone to share my story with",
	"..that shoulder to cry on, that someone to cheer you up.",
	"Meeting someone like her again is hard.",
	"But I'd do anything to be with my big sister Elaine again.",
	"If I could only go back to 2013",
	"just for one year,",
	"even if I have to throw everything away, I'd do it.",
	"My story with her might be sad, sure, but it's not all sad.",
	"I could be a sadder sack of shit right now if it wasn't for her",
	"or, you know, I could be dead right now.",
	"Who knows? I could still be alive, but look at the world as this cold, barren, piece of shit place",
	"and I'd hate everyone.",
	"But.. I don't, and I think everyone has some form of good within them.",
	"And I look at the world in a better light. The world might seem doom, but I have hope.",
	"I believe in the possibility of a better tomorrow.",
	"Elaine may be gone from my life, but the things she left behind still linger with me.",
	"She just made me a better person",
	"and I love her for that.",
	"(Not in a romantic way, just to get that out. In a way that a brother would tell his big sister.)",
	"Elaine wasn't the only hero in my life, though.",
	"There are countless others.",
	"ESPECIALLY the people in my block.",
	"I don't show it that much, and I doubt my blockmates know this",
	"but I fucking love my block.",
	"They're seriously the best and most fun group of classmates I've ever been in.",
	"They helped and chipped in for me at time when I needed it.",
	"Some people gave me lunch when I had nothing to eat.",
	"I remember this one specific event",
	"the day after I posted about my current financial situation.",
	"A friend of mine gave me money to eat lunch",
	"and I've been starving that whole week.",
	"To be honest, I felt like crying when I learned that my blockmates gave me money just to eat for the day.",
	"Ah, my second term in my second year was a tough one",
	"but I've got friends",
	"so I got through it.",
	"And, because they deserved it, I personally would like to thank, from the bottom of my heart",
	"these awesome blockmates for having helped me during tough times:",
	"Justin Parado",
	"Nicole Lopez",
	"Nathan Melad",
	"James Baldelomar",
	"Rene Valguna",
	"Samantha Munar",
	"Andrey Buzon",
	"John Bautista",
	"and Hugo Dimaranan",
	"(oh, and the entire block of SS151).",
	"They're not the only ones who helped me, though. My org family, APC Speaks, helped me as well.",
	"Even Loy's family decided to help me out by basically covering my education.",
	"Countless other individuals also helped me, Paula Vesliño, Kenard Pascua, Ate Betina Dela Cruz, Andrea Aguillon, Ate Ding and Ate Ching Parado, and so much more.",
	"The truth is, I wasn't not born rich, and I was born into a depressing life.",
	"Horrible, abusive dad at early childhood,",
	"separation of parents at an early age,",
	"and being put into a family that doesn't give a shit about you.",
	"Oh, and the alcoholic uncle that slams your door and says mean shit to you every month.",
	"Plus add the selfish-as-hell Dad that won't help you as a free DLC.",
	"I wasn't really supposed to amount to anything, and my destiny would've been a hard life.",
	"Were it not for all of the people that have helped me and put faith in me.",
	"If no one really cared about me, if no one really gave a shit about me",
	"then, for one, I wouldn't be studying, I would've dropped out of my second year in college.",
	"And I wouldn't drop out on a light note as well, I would drop out as an infuriated and depressed kid that didn't talk to anyone.",
	"With a broken family, a broken heart, and a broken future",
	"I would probably commit suicide then and there.",
	"I would be dead",
	"but.. I didn't.",
	"I'm studying, I'm happy, and I've got people helping me.",
	"I wasn't born into a \"normal family\"",
	"but I'm glad that the family I have now has so many members, it's hard to count.",
	"They all pitched in and made me who I am today.",
	"My mission in life is to really make the world a better place.",
	"Not because I want fame or notoriety",
	"but I just want to pay the kindness forward.",
	"And I want to help others as much as others have helped me.",
	"I'm still quite young, and I still have a lot to learn",
	"still I have a brave soul, and I doubt I'll be going quietly into the night soon.",
	"The moral of my story thus far?",
	"",
	"Always be good.",
	"Be understanding.",
	"Be kind.",
	"Be that friend who everyone can cry on and cheer others up.",
	"Just be a kind person.",
	"That's all. I have to say goodbye now. I hope you had fun reading as much as I did writing.",
	"Feel free to leave a comment or talk to me, if ever.",
	"I'll be there.",
	"Until next time! And in my Sone-way of saying goodbye...",
	"Annyeong! Really, really good goodbye.",
	"Bye bye~",
