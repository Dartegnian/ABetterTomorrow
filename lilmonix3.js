	"then I suggest starting with one \"One Last Time.\"",
	"Go on YouTube right now and search for \"one last time snsd english lyrics\"",
	"and listen to it, plus the translations are synced up so you know what they're saying.",
	"It's such a great song, seriously. Oh my God.",
	"The first I listened to the song along with the translation, it made my hairs stand on end.",
	"\"One Last Time\" is basically a song about",
	"knowing that your relationship will come to an end soon.",
	"The song doesn't state the goodbye of a romantic relationship.",
	"Just any relationship wherein you loved the other person.",
	"You know,",
	"if I could sing this to Elaine (in English)",

	"But this comeback..",
	"I don't know, it just feels empty without Elaine.",
	"The last time I was with her and SNSD released something new",
	"was \"Mr. Mr.\", and I even changed her blog theme here on Blogger to have the aesthetic of that album.",
	"Man, I miss Elaine so much.",
	"She was the best friend I could ever ask for.",
	"In the year 2013, that's when I really felt Elaine's presence in my life.",
	"I had extreme problems on that year.",
	"I was depressed, I was angry, I felt unloved",
	"I-I felt lonely.",

	"sometimes she slapped some sense into me.",
	"I know she's talked to my mom and she talked to me about my family problems at one point.",
	"I'm sure it was stressful on her part because I was so stubborn",
	"but we eventually came over that",
	"and we slowly became the best of friends.",
	"Even so far as to thinking that the other is a long-lost sibling.",
	"But then, late 2014 happened.",
	"With Jessica leaving the group, and with SNSD winding down their activities,",

	"If I could only go back to 2013",
	"just for one year,",
	"even if I have to throw everything away, I'd do it.",
	"My story with her might be sad, sure, but it's not all sad.",
	"I could be a sadder sack of shit right now if it wasn't for her",
	"or, you know, I could be dead right now.",
	"Who knows? I could still be alive, but look at the world as this cold, barren, piece of shit place",
	"and I'd hate everyone.",
	"But.. I don't, and I think everyone has some form of good within them.",
	"And I look at the world in a better light. The world might seem doomed, but I have hope.",
	"I believe in the possibility of a better tomorrow.",
	"Elaine may be gone from my life, but the things she left behind still linger with me.",
	"She just made me a better person",
	"and I love her for that.",
	"(Not in a romantic way, just to get that out. In a way that a brother would tell his big sister.)",
	"Elaine wasn't the only hero in my life, though.",
	"There are countless others.",
	"ESPECIALLY the people in my block.",
	"I don't show it that much, and I doubt my blockmates know this",
	"but I fucking love my block.",

	"the day after I posted about my current financial situation.",
	"A friend of mine gave me money to eat lunch",
	"and I've been starving that whole week.",
	"To be honest, I felt like crying when I learned that my blockmates gave me money just to eat for the day.",
	"Ah, my second term in my second year was a tough one",
	"but I've got friends",
	"so I got through it.",

	"Even Loy's family decided to help me out by basically covering my education.",
	"Countless other individuals also helped me, Paula Vesliño, Kenard Pascua, Ate Betina Dela Cruz, Andrea Aguillon, Ate Ding and Ate Ching Parado, and so much more.",
	"The truth is, I wasn't not born rich, and I was born into a depressing life.",
	"Horrible, abusive dad at early childhood,",
	"separation of parents at an early age,",
	"and being put into a family that doesn't give a shit about you.",
	"Oh, and the alcoholic uncle that slams your door and says mean shit to you every month.",
	"Plus add the selfish-as-hell Dad that won't help you as a free DLC.",
	"I wasn't really supposed to amount to anything, and my destiny would've been a hard life.",
	"Were it not for all of the people that have helped me and put faith in me.",
	"If no one really cared about me, if no one really gave a shit about me",
	"then, for one, I wouldn't be studying, I would've dropped out of my second year in college.",
	"And I wouldn't drop out on a light note as well, I would drop out as an infuriated and depressed kid that didn't talk to anyone.",
	"With a broken family, a broken heart, and a broken future",
	"I would probably commit suicide then and there.",
	"I would be dead",
	"but.. I didn't.",
	"I'm studying, I'm happy, and I've got people helping me.",
	"I wasn't born into a \"normal family\"",
	"but I'm glad that the family I have now has so many members, it's hard to count.",
	"They all pitched in and made me who I am today.",
	"My mission in life is to really make the world a better place.",
	"Not because I want fame or notoriety",
	"but I just want to pay the kindness forward.",
	"And I want to help others as much as others have helped me.",
	"I'm still quite young, and I still have a lot to learn",
	"still I have a brave soul, and I doubt I'll be going quietly into the night soon.",
	"The moral of my story thus far?",
