/**
* Code "borrowed" from somewhere else :^)
* Psshh, nothing personnel, kid.
* 
* Okay, seriously.
* Even I think this is a little immature, but
* I like references and easter eggs anyway, so
* I squeezed this little thing here just for
* laughs and stuff. Don't judge me.
* 
* Every line in the message script below
* contains meaning. Whether it's a throwback
* to old stuff on the Internet, to recent memes.
* Every line in here was meticulously typed
* by hand to convey meaning.
* 
* Oh, and it's my personal site/blog anyway, I can do
* whatever I want with it. But yeah, I think
* this is a little immature, even for me.
* This code contains a lot of my personality
* and the things I like. So, uh, be careful?
* 
* I also added some lines from my favorite songs here.
* This isn't really the place to explain my preference,
* but I rarely get to talk about it.
* The type of songs I like the most are the ones with
* the most meaningful lyrics.
* Of course, with the majority of these songs being
* in a foreign language, there's NO WAY I could
* possibly know of a song's meaning just by listening.
* But that's not the point.
* First, I like songs that have a good beat and rhythm.
* But what really gets me, and makes the song linger more
* in my head, is if the song has meaningful lyrics.
* The best way I could think about it is through fishing.
* An okay song, for me, is one that gets me with a good "hook."
* But if the song fails to capture me with creative lyrics, I
* eventually let go of it.
* If I found out that the lyrics of the song mean well, in
* addition to the lovely beat it has, then that will really
* "reel me in."
* At that point, the song just doesn't leave a lasting impression
* on my playlist, but it now leaves a lasting impression on my heart.
* And, in rare occasions, it helps me understand my actions, feelings,
* and who I am a person as well.
* That's why I love music!
* I hope my analogy was alright, ahaha. But yeah, here are
* some songs that struck a chord with me.
