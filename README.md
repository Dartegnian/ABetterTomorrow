# A Better Tomorrow
This is the GitHub repository that my blog (https://www.dartegnian.co) uses. It contains some assets, some stuff in development, and other resources.
This does not contain the source code nor the XML theme of my blog and it never will.

## What's included

### Dev console script
A script written in Javascript that outputs messages from an array into any browser console.

### Inactive tab HTML title changer
Changes the title of an inactive tab into something else. Selects a random title based on an array and cycles through them every 5 seconds.

### Monika
<a href="http://doki-doki-literature-club.wikia.com/wiki/Monika">Monika</a> from <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/">Doki Doki Literature Club</a>. Based on the ```dev console script``` and pops up an image of Monika along with a custom script related to her. Only appears in the Chrome dev console.
