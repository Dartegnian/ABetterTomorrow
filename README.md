# A Better Tomorrow
This is the GitHub repository that my main blog/website (https://www.dartegnian.com) uses. It contains some assets, some stuff in development, and other miscellaneous resources.
This Git repository does not contain the Blogger source code nor the main XML theme of my blog, and it never will.

## What's inside

### Web browser console script
File: `somestupidvirus.js`

A script written in JavaScript that outputs messages from an array into any browser console.

### Inactive tab title changer
File: `definitelynotmaliciouscode.js`

JavaScript code that detects if the tab of the website (in this case, my blog) is out of focus. Then, it selects a random title based on an array and cycles through all of the elements in the array every 5 seconds.

### Monika
File: `lilmonix3.js`
